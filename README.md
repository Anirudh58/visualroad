# Visual Road: A Video Data Management Benchmark

Please see the [project website](http://visualroad.uwdb.io) for more details about the benchmark, links to the papers, sample videos, and pregenerated datasets.

## Building the Visual Road Docker Image

Because of licensing restrictions on the Unreal engine, we cannot release a pre-built Docker container for the Visual Road benchmark.  However, we have striven to make the build process as painless as possible!

1. Download and build the `ue4-docker:4.22.0` container using the [ue4-docker build instructions](https://adamrehn.com/docs/ue4-docker/read-these-first/introduction-to-ue4-docker).  Visual Road depends on Unreal version 4.22.0 and only supports Linux builds.
2. Clone the [Visual Road repository](https://github.com/uwdb/visualroad) and build the core docker container: `docker build -t visualroad/core`

## Synthetic Dataset Generation

1. Initiate dataset generation by running the `generator` service.  For example, the following command generates a scale-one dataset named `my-dataset`: `docker-compose run generator --scale 1 my-dataset`.
2. The generator service supports a number of additional options (e.g., `--height`, `--width`, `--duration`).  Execute `docker-compose run generator -h` for a complete list.

## Generating Benchmark Queries

1. After creating a synthetic dataset, generate a suite of benchmark queries by invoking the driver service: `docker-compose run driver [path to synthetic dataset]`.  The dataset path must be _a subdirectory within the current directory_ (e.g., `/home/root/dataset` will not work).
2. The driver will emit YAML to standard output with query parameters.  As an example, an abbreviated output for the first two instances of Q1 might read:

```yml
source: my-dataset
batches:
- batch:
  query: '1'
  - query:
      path: traffic-000.mp4
      t:
      - 2
      - 30
      x:
      - 360
      - 1875
      y:
      - 683
      - 1001
  - query:
      path: traffic-002.mp4
      t:
      - 18
      - 228
      x:
      - 1481
      - 1736
      y:
      - 825
      - 902
...
```

## Verifying Query Results

1. Visual Road's verification service may be optionally invoked to ensure that query results conform with the benchmark requirements.  To do so, execute the verification service: `docker-compose run verifier -q [path to driver query YAML] -r [result YAML]`.  The driver YAML is the file generated by the previous step, and the result YAML is a user-constructed file using the following format:

```yml
- result:
  query: '1'
  - result-q1-1.mp4 # Path to result for instance 1 of query 1
  - result-q1-2.mp4 # Paths must be under the directory where the verifier is invoked
  - result-q1-3.mp4
  - result-q1-4.mp4

- result:
  query: '2a'
  - result-q2a-1.mp4
  - result-q2a-1.mp4
  - result-q2a-1.mp4
  - result-q2a-1.mp4

...  
```

2. The verifier may be applied to datasets other than the one on which the driver was executed.  To do so, execute the verifier with the `--dataset` option.  See the verifier help (`-h`) for other options.
